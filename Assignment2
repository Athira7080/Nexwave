Q:
Create a python program that creates a dictionary of 5 devices for the foll. devices(ROM,HDD,FDD,RAM,CPU).
Each device in your dict. should contain the name of the device and a description of the device.
Allow for user input to be able to perform some look up from the dict. and display if the device exists,display device description.
Also allow user input to be able to search for device info.just by typing in the first letter of a particular device.If more than one device exists for an initial letter, 
then display each matching device info. sorted by device.Include a default message if a devoice does not exist for a particular search request.

d={'ROM':'Read Only Memory','HDD':'Hard Disk Drive','FDD':'Floppy Disk Drive','RAM':'Random Access Memory','CPU':'Central Processing Unit'}

dev_key=d.keys()
dev_key=list(dev_key)
dev_key.sort()


print('Dictionary consists of: ',dev_key, 'devices')

while True:
    dev_name = input('Enter a device name to be searched')
    if dev_name in dev_key:
        print(d[dev_name])

    elif len(dev_name)>1:
        print('Not found')
    else:
        for dev in dev_key:
            if dev.startswith(dev_name):
                print(d[dev])

    ch=input('Do you want to continue(y/n):')
    if ch=='n':
        break
